# Language Exchange little guide

* Language Exchange: Say we have 2 hours in total this time, then the ideal arrangement is 1 hour for Chinese, the other hour for English (half half basically).<br>
語言交換: 假設我們有2小時，那麼就一小時中文一小時英文(基本上就是一半一半)

<br>

* In Chinese time, we speak in Chinese. In English time, speak in English.
在中文的時段哩，我們全程說中文; 英文時段全程說英文。

<br>

* You can bring anything you want, basically that one hour is yours, you can ask me to do anything you want as long as I can answer you. Meaning you can not only ask me Chinese questions, but any. 
你可以準備任何你想要的東西，基本上那一小時就是你的了。你可以問我任何問題，只要在我能力所及的放為即可。也就是說你不一定要問我有關中文的問題。

<br>

* These are merely prompts. If there are other things you want to ask or talk about, we address those first. Then when there is nothing more, we can use these prompts to fill up the rest of the time.
這些僅僅是提示罷了，還是以你當時的想法優先，等真的沒話題了再拿這些出來聊即可。

<br>

* <span style="color:red">Extend your answer</span>
盡可能的說得仔細一點。

<br>

* Tell me if you think the topics are inappropiate.
如果你覺得有些話題不妥的話，跟我說。

<br>

* Above this file are the topics, click into them.
上面就是一個個的話題，點進去即可看到。

<br>

* If you want to talk about something specifically, let me know, maybe I can make one.
如過你有什麼特別想聊的，可以跟我說，說不定我可以做一個出來。

<br>

* I think I will try my best not to speak over/interject you when it is your time. So <span style="color:red">let me know if I should correct you if you have any mistakes. beforehand</span> Because I know some people think they are fine as long as they are understandable, while some pursue perfection.
在你的時段時，我想我應該會盡量得讓你說，所以請提前跟我說我需不需要訂正你的錯誤。因為我知道有些人是只要能夠被理解的話，就算有錯誤也沒差，但是同時，有些人追求的是完美。

<br>

* Feel free to ask me any questions, I know some times it will be very tricky to get to a specific point you want.
我可以理解有時候要問到自己的問題是非常困難的，所以不用擔心，儘管問我問題。

<br>

* I believe everyone has their own different answer for a same question. My answers only stands for myself, though I don't think it would be too much different to others'. It is just a disclaimer. Identically, I will take everyting with a pinch of salt, therefore, feel free to give me your answers too!
我認為就算是同一個問題，每個人或多或少都還是會有一些不同的回答。雖然我不覺得我的答案會與其他人的有很多不同，但我還是先聲明，我的回答只是我的想法。同樣的我也會不會對我得到的任何答案照單全收，所以不用擔心，盡量跟我說你的回答即可。
