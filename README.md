# Language Exchange little guide

* Language Exchange: Say we have 2 hours in total this time, then the ideal arrangement is 1 hour for chinese, the other hour for English (half half basically).

<br>

* In Chinese time, we speak in Chinese. In English time, speak in English.

<br>

* You can bring anything you want, basically that one hour is yours, you can ask me to do anything you want as long as I can answer you. Meaning you can not only ask me Chinese questions, but any. 

<br>

* These are merely prompts. If there are other things you want to ask or talk about, we address those first. Then when there is nothing more, we can use these prompts to fill up the rest of the time.

<br>

* Tell me if you think the topics are inappropiate.
